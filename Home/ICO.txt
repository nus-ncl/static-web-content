               <p>The International Cybersecurity Olympiad (ICO) is a prestigious global event inspired by renowned competitions such as the International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) and the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). ICO is led by university professors, cybersecurity practitioners, and industry professionals, including Associate Professor Tan Sun Teck, the current President of IOI.</p>
               <br/>
               <p>The School of Computing at the National University of Singapore (NUS-SoC) is proud to host the inaugural International Cybersecurity Olympiad (ICO 2025) from June 22 to June 28, 2025.</p>
               </br>
