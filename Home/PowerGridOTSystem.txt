            <p>The primary objective of the project is to develop a scaled-down Operational Technology (OT) digital twin/equivalent — the Mini OT-Energy-System Cyber Security Test Platform is a comprehensive software platform designed to simulate the essential operations of a small-scale hybrid power grid. This system will meet the requirements for cybersecurity training, exercises, and research, serving as an essential platform for assessing the resilience and security of OT environments in power systems.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>This digital twin provides a dynamic environment for simulating power generation from multiple sources, including natural gas power plants, solar farms, and wind turbine farms. It also simulates high-voltage power transmission and a three-level step-down distribution system.</p>

              <h2 class="news-header"><font color="#0d6dba">System Overview & Design:</font></h2>
             <p>The system architecture consists of three primary modules:</p>
<ul>
                <li> <b>2D Visualization Program:</b> Simulates the physical-world devices and components of the power grid, providing a clear visual representation of grid operations.</li>
                <li> <b>OT Field Controller Simulation:</b> Includes simulation programs for PLCs, sensors, Metering Units (MUs), and Remote-Control Units (RTUs) that enable interaction between the grid’s physical elements and the control systems</li>
                <li> <b>SCADA-HMI System:</b> Provides supervisory control and real-time monitoring of the simulated power grid, allowing for detailed oversight of grid performance and operations.</li>
            </ul>
            <br/>
