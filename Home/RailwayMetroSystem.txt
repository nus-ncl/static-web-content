            <p>Land based Railway System was built in 2023 by NCL development team, for research in cyber security. Its purpose is to help ICS researchers and instructors test IT/OT attack and defense solutions and provide a platform for ICS security training and education.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Our idea on creating a digital version of the railway system simulation platform, designed to replicate the operation of multiple trains traversing distinct tracks, each equipped with unique sensor-signal controls. This platform is intended to serve as a valuable resource for cybersecurity researchers, enabling them to demonstrate and assess the impact of various types of IT attacks on operational technology (OT) systems. The platform comprises six primary components(programs):</p>

            <h3>What might this system be useful for: </h3>
            </br>
            <ul>
             <li> <strong>Training and Education: </strong> This system serves as an invaluable tool for educating students about Railway Systems, their components, and operational processes.</li>
             <li> <strong>Testing and Validation: </strong> The system can be employed to rigorously test and validate the effectiveness of products or assess the credibility of logical processes.</li>
             <li> <strong> Security Testing: </strong> For those interested in testing their skills set identifying vulnerabilities in railway systems, we offer a secure environment where you can engage in ethical hacking exercises.</li>
             <li> <strong>Research and Development: </strong> NCL also provides a diverse range of GPUs available for rent, enhancing the quality of your research and development efforts in the field of Railway Systems.</li>
            </ul>

            <br/>

            <h3>Collaboration</h3>
            </br>
            <p>NCL is engaged in an international cyber security exercise, presenting our Railway System. Our railway infrastructure will serve as a live operational technology (OT) target for red team to exploit.</p>
            </br>
            <p>we have meticulously prepared a set of compelling attack scenarios. primed for demonstration. If you are intrigued and eager to learn more information, please feel free to reach out to us at:</p>
