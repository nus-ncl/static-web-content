                        Prior to the Bali event, NCL conducted four cybersecurity training sessions
                        and a pre-training session before the competition.
                        These sessions covered a wide range of concepts,
                        incorporating Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) presented in the form of riddles and puzzles,
                        scenario-based questions on cyber incidents,
                        and a meaningful storyline with quests to captivate the participating students.
                        The training sessions also emphasized a higher points weightage assigned
                        to more complex scenarios, ensuring a challenging learning environment.
